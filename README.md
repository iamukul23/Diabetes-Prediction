🩺 Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting whether a person is diabetic or not using machine learning techniques. The model is trained on medical diagnostic data and provides an effective way to assist in early detection of diabetes.

📌 Project Overview

Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects millions worldwide. Early diagnosis can help in managing the condition effectively.
This project uses a machine learning classification model to predict diabetes based on health parameters such as glucose level, BMI, age, etc.
